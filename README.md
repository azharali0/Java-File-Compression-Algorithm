# Java-File-Compression-Algorithm
The Huffman algorithm, a popular lossless data compression technique, uses variable-length binary codes to compress files. By assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters,
it minimizes file size without losing data. This method is widely used for efficient storage and faster data transmission.
